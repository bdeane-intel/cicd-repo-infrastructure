== Libraries and warnings

This repository
https://github.com/intel/cicd-repo-infrastructure/blob/main/cmake/warnings.cmake[provides
an `INTERFACE` library] called `warnings` that, when linked with, applies
warnings to the code.

One of the problems commonly encountered with using strict warnings is the
problem of dependencies: you donâ€™t want to enforce warnings on third-party
libraries. Any warnings that arise from third-party libraries we typically want
to ignore; i.e. we want to treat that library as a system library. To do this,
we can use `target_link_libraries_system`, for example:

[source,cmake]
----
add_executable(my_app src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE my_lib warnings)
target_link_libraries_system(my_app PRIVATE fmt::fmt-header-only)
----

This is also used internally by functions like `add_unit_test` to silence
warnings in unit tests frameworks.

This repository also
https://github.com/intel/cicd-repo-infrastructure/blob/main/cmake/profile.cmake[provides
an `INTERFACE` library] called `profile-compilation` that, when linked with,
passes profiling flags to the compiler, so that slow compilations can be
tackled.

[source,cmake]
----
add_executable(my_app src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE my_lib profile-compilation)
----
